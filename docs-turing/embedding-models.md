# Embedding Models

An **Embedding Model** converts text into a high-dimensional numerical vector that captures its semantic meaning. These vectors enable similarity search — finding documents conceptually related to a query even when they share no common keywords.

Turing ES uses embedding models in two phases:

- **Indexing** — document chunks are vectorized and stored in the [Embedding Store](./embedding-stores.md)
- **Querying** — the user's question is vectorized with the same model and compared against stored vectors

:::warning Same model for indexing and querying
The embedding model must remain consistent across both phases. Changing the model after documents have been indexed causes dimension mismatches and incorrect similarity results. A **full re-indexing** of all content is required whenever the embedding model changes.

## Supported Providers

Embedding model support depends on the LLM vendor configured in the [LLM Instance](./llm-instances.md). Not all vendors provide an embedding API.

| Provider | Embedding Support | Example Models | Default Model |
|---|:---:|---|---|
| **OpenAI** | Yes | `text-embedding-3-small`, `text-embedding-3-large`, `text-embedding-ada-002` | `text-embedding-3-small` |
| **Ollama** | Yes | `nomic-embed-text`, `mxbai-embed-large`, `all-minilm` | *(configurable)* |
| **Gemini** | Yes | `gemini-embedding-001` *(asymmetric task types — see below)* | `gemini-embedding-001` |
| **OpenAI-Compatible** | Yes* | whatever the backing endpoint exposes at `/embeddings` | *(per endpoint)* |
| **Bedrock** | Yes | `amazon.titan-embed-*`, `cohere.embed-*` | — |
| **Voyage AI** | Yes | `voyage-3`, `voyage-3-large`, `voyage-context-3`, `voyage-multimodal-3` | `voyage-3` |
| **Cohere** | Yes | `embed-v4.0` (multilingual / multimodal / Matryoshka) | `embed-v4.0` |
| **Mistral AI** | Yes | `mistral-embed` | `mistral-embed` |
| **Vertex AI** | Yes | Gemini embeddings on GCP (reuses the native Gemini stack) | — |
| **Anthropic** | No | — | — |
| **Gemini (OpenAI-compatible)** | No | — | — |

> \* OpenAI-Compatible embeds only when the backing endpoint actually exposes `/embeddings`. **Azure OpenAI is no longer a vendor** — reach an Azure embedding deployment via OpenAI-Compatible. See [LLM Instances](./llm-instances.md#capabilities-by-vendor).

### OpenAI

Connects to the OpenAI API (default: `https://api.openai.com/v1`) using your API key. OpenAI offers three embedding model families:

| Model | Dimensions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `text-embedding-3-small` | 1,536 | Best cost-performance balance for most deployments |
| `text-embedding-3-large` | 3,072 | Higher quality, larger storage footprint |
| `text-embedding-ada-002` | 1,536 | Legacy model — use `3-small` for new deployments |

### Ollama (Local)

Runs embedding models locally via [Ollama](https://ollama.com). No API key required for local deployments — ideal for air-gapped environments or development.

| Model | Dimensions | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `nomic-embed-text` | 768 | Good general-purpose model, lightweight |
| `mxbai-embed-large` | 1,024 | Higher quality, more resource-intensive |
| `all-minilm` | 384 | Very lightweight, fast inference |

Pull a model before using it:

```bash
ollama pull nomic-embed-text
```

### Local Transformers (ONNX)

Turing ES also supports running embedding models **locally, in-process** via ONNX Runtime, without an external LLM provider, API or key. This is useful for air-gapped deployments, custom/fine-tuned models, and zero-cost embeddings.

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Model Path** | Location of the `.onnx` model file. Accepts a `classpath:`, `file:` or `https:` URI. Remote (`https:`) resources are **downloaded and cached** on first use. |
| **Tokenizer Path** | Location of `tokenizer.json` (same URI schemes as above). |
| **Enable GPU** | Toggle GPU acceleration via ONNX Runtime |
| **Batch Size** | Number of texts to embed per batch |

The default recommended model is `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dimensional, ~80 MB), a small, fast sentence-transformers model. For example, point **Model Path** at `https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2/resolve/main/onnx/model.onnx` and **Tokenizer Path** at the matching `.../tokenizer.json`; the first embedding call downloads and caches both.

#### Zero-config local RAG at startup

A fresh install (notably the public demo) can provision a complete local retrieval backend automatically, with no admin step. When a global [Default AI Agent](./ai-agents.md) is configured and no embedding model or vector store exists yet, Turing ES creates a local ONNX embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) plus an embedded [Lucene vector store](./embedding-stores.md), registers both as the global defaults, wires them onto the Default AI Agent (enabling RAG), then downloads the model and reindexes existing content into the store — so grounded chat works out of the box.

It is controlled by `turing.startup.default-rag.*`:

| Property | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `turing.startup.default-rag.enabled` | `true` | Master switch for the startup provisioning. |
| `turing.startup.default-rag.model-name` | `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` | Display name of the provisioned embedding model. |
| `turing.startup.default-rag.model-path` | HuggingFace `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` ONNX URL | Overrides the ONNX model URI. |
| `turing.startup.default-rag.tokenizer-path` | HuggingFace `tokenizer.json` URL | Overrides the tokenizer URI. |
| `turing.startup.default-rag.store-path` | `./store/lucene-vector` | Filesystem root for the Lucene index. |
| `turing.startup.default-rag.reindex` | `true` | Reindex existing site content into the new store after provisioning. |
| `turing.genai.embedding.local.cache-dir` | *(temp dir)* | Where downloaded ONNX/tokenizer resources are cached; set a persistent path to keep them across restarts. |

The step is **idempotent** — it acts only on a fresh install (no embedding model and no store yet) and never overrides an existing setup.

## Advanced embedding capabilities

Beyond plain text→vector, Turing ES exploits provider-specific embedding features. Each is **opt-in by model choice** — pick the right model on the right vendor and the capability engages; everything else keeps the classic per-chunk text path byte-for-byte.

### Asymmetric task types (Gemini)

`gemini-embedding-001` embeds a *document* and a *query* differently for a measured retrieval-quality win the OpenAI/Anthropic models can't match. Turing applies it automatically through the standard VectorStore convention — index-time calls use `RETRIEVAL_DOCUMENT`, query-time calls use `RETRIEVAL_QUERY` — with **zero caller changes**. An optional Matryoshka `outputDimensionality` provider option trades a smaller vector for lower storage/IO. Voyage and Bedrock embedding models apply the same asymmetric `document`/`query` distinction.

### Contextualized chunk embeddings (Voyage `voyage-context-3`)

Attacks the classic RAG failure where a chunk is meaningless without its surrounding section. Instead of embedding each chunk in isolation, `voyage-context-3` embeds every chunk **together with its siblings** so each vector carries document context. Select a `*context*` Voyage model (or set the `contextual` provider option) and the asset indexer embeds a document's chunks as a group and upserts the precomputed vectors. It is **fail-soft** — a non-contextual model, a vector-count mismatch, or any error falls back to per-chunk embedding. Query time is unchanged.

### Multimodal embeddings — search text → match an image (Voyage `voyage-multimodal-3`)

Embeds images *and* text into one shared vector space, so a plain-text query can match a PDF page-image, diagram, or screenshot the text-only path can't reach. Select a `*multimodal*` Voyage model (or set the `multimodal` option); images are indexed tagged `_modality=image`, and a text query is embedded in the same space and KNN-matched against image vectors. Exposed at `/api/v2/multimodal` (`available` / `image` upload / `search`); text-only models stay the default. Cohere `embed-v4.0` is likewise multimodal.

### Domain-specialized model per site

Each Semantic Navigation site can pin its **own** embedding model (`embeddingModelId` override on its GenAI config) — `voyage-law` for legal docs, `voyage-code` for code search, `voyage-finance` for finance, or a Cohere domain model — while every other site stays on the platform default. The site's hybrid-ranking path resolves the override for **both** index and query halves, so its per-site `sn_<siteId>` collection never mismatches. Null/blank = platform default.

:::warning Switching a site's model = re-index that site
A different model is a different vector space. Changing a site's embedding model requires clearing and re-indexing **that site's** collection.
:::

### Quantized / Matryoshka vectors

For the embedded Lucene store, scalar quantization (`INT8` / `INT4` / `SEVEN_BIT` / `BINARY`) shrinks the index and speeds search at a measured recall cost. It pairs with Matryoshka `outputDimensionality` truncation (on the Voyage/Gemini models) to compound the savings. Configured on the **store**, not the model — see [Embedding Stores → Lucene (embedded)](./embedding-stores.md#lucene-embedded).

### Mistral OCR extraction bridge

Not an embedding model itself, but it feeds the embedding pipeline: for scanned PDFs and image-only documents that Apache Tika reads poorly, Turing can call Mistral's OCR API (`mistral-ocr-latest`) to produce layout-aware Markdown before chunking and embedding. It runs **only** when a file is OCR-eligible *and* Tika produced no usable text, so ordinary documents spend no OCR credits. Opt-in via `turing.ocr.*`; disabled or keyless → inert (returns the Tika text), and any OCR error fails soft back to Tika.

## Choosing a Model

The embedding model determines two things:

- **Dimensionality** — the number of dimensions in the vector (e.g., 384, 768, 1,536, 3,072). Higher dimensions capture more nuance but require more storage.
- **Semantic quality** — how well the model captures meaning. Larger models generally produce better similarity results at the cost of slower indexing.

### Recommendations

| Scenario | Recommended Model | Provider |
|---|---|---|
| **General production** | `text-embedding-3-small` | OpenAI |
| **Maximum quality** | `text-embedding-3-large` | OpenAI |
| **Local / air-gapped** | `nomic-embed-text` | Ollama |
| **Resource-constrained** | `all-minilm` | Ollama |
| **Best retrieval quality** | `gemini-embedding-001` *(asymmetric task types)* | Gemini |
| **Retrieval specialist / domain** | `voyage-3-large`, `voyage-law`, `voyage-code` | Voyage AI |
| **Long-chunk context** | `voyage-context-3` | Voyage AI |
| **Search text → image** | `voyage-multimodal-3`, `embed-v4.0` | Voyage AI / Cohere |
| **Custom fine-tuned** | Your `.onnx` model | Local Transformers |

For most deployments, a mid-sized model such as `text-embedding-3-small` (OpenAI) or `nomic-embed-text` (Ollama) provides a good balance between quality and performance.

## Global Configuration

Set the default embedding model in **Administration → Settings**:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Default Embedding Model** | The embedding model used to generate vectors at indexing and query time |

Individual Semantic Navigation Sites can override this setting in their **Generative AI** tab.

The Knowledge Base always uses the global default.

---

## REST API

Embedding models are managed via the REST API at `/api/embedding-model`.

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/embedding-model` | List all embedding models |
| `GET` | `/api/embedding-model/structure` | Get the structure template for a new model |
| `GET` | `/api/embedding-model/{id}` | Get a specific embedding model |
| `POST` | `/api/embedding-model` | Create a new embedding model |
| `PUT` | `/api/embedding-model/{id}` | Update an existing embedding model |
| `DELETE` | `/api/embedding-model/{id}` | Delete an embedding model |

---

## Per-Site Override

Each Semantic Navigation Site can override the global embedding model in its **Generative AI** tab. This allows different sites to use different models — for example, a multilingual site might use a model optimized for cross-language embeddings while a technical site uses a domain-specific model.

The site-level configuration includes:

| Setting | Description |
|---|---|
| **Embedding Model** | Overrides the global default for this site |
| **Embedding Store** | Overrides the global store backend for this site |
| **LLM Instance** | The chat/reasoning model for this site's GenAI features |
