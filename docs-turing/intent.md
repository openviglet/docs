# Intent

> *The hardest part of any AI product isn't the AI — it's getting the user to ask the first question. **Intents** are how you put a hundred good first questions, in your customer's voice, on the chat home screen. And **Vibe Coding** is how you write all of them in five minutes.*

The **Intent** feature (`/admin/intent/instance`) manages categorized prompt suggestions that appear in the Chat interface. Intents provide users with pre-built conversation starters organized by topic, making it easier to discover and use the AI capabilities of Turing ES.

Each intent represents a **category** (e.g., *"Boost my work productivity"*) containing one or more **actions** — each action is a labeled prompt that is sent directly to the chat when clicked.

Think of intents as the *hook* on the home screen of every conversation. The customer didn't type a question yet — they're staring at the prompt box wondering what to ask. Intents say *"here's what people like you ask"*, in their language. Conversion starts here.

## Intent Listing

The listing page shows all configured intents as a grid of cards. Each card displays:

- **Title** — the intent category name
- **Description** — a brief explanation of the category
- **Icon** — a Lucide icon representing the category

A **New Intent** button at the top opens the creation form. Clicking an existing card navigates to its detail page.

---

## Creating or Editing an Intent

The intent form is divided into three sections.

### General Information

| Field | Max Length | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Title | 150 chars | Category name displayed in the chat interface (required) |
| Description | 500 chars | Brief explanation of what prompts this intent provides |
| Icon | — | Lucide icon picker — select an icon to represent this category |

### Actions

Actions are the individual prompts within an intent category. Each action has:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Label | Short action label shown to the user (e.g., "Create daily schedule") — required |
| Prompt | The full prompt text sent to the chat when the user clicks this action — required |

Actions support **drag-and-drop reordering** — drag the handle on each action card to change the display order. Use the **Add Action** button to create new actions, and the trash icon to remove existing ones.

:::tip Write actions in the customer's voice
The label is what the user clicks. The prompt is what the LLM receives. They don't have to be the same. The label should sound like *the user asking themselves a question* (*"Help me prepare for my next 1-on-1"*); the prompt can be a more elaborate brief for the LLM (*"Help me prepare for a 1-on-1 meeting with my manager. Suggest topics, questions to ask, and a way to bring up career growth."*). The pairing is what makes intents feel like a friendly assistant rather than a search box.

### Status

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Enabled | Toggle to show or hide this intent in the chat interface. Disabled intents are not visible to users. |

## Vibe Coding: Author Intents With AI

Writing 4 categories × 6 actions × 2 languages = 48 prompts is exactly the kind of work the AI is best at. The Intent form has a **Vibe Coding** mode — you describe what you want; the assistant drafts the entire intent.

> **You:** *"Make me an intent for new product owners. Six actions covering the first 30 days on the job — backlog grooming, stakeholder mapping, OKRs, the first sprint demo, a retro plan, and a simple metric to track."*
>
> **Assistant:** *"Done. Title: 'New Product Owner — First 30 Days'. Icon: graduation-cap. Six actions ready:*
> *— `Map your stakeholders` → 'Help me build a stakeholder map for my first month as PO. Roles, influence, what they need from me, and one question I should ask each of them.'*
> *— `Groom the backlog` → 'Walk me through grooming a backlog I just inherited. What's the right order to clean it?'*
> *— `Set OKRs for the first quarter` → ...*
> *Want me to also write a Portuguese version?"*

The same pattern as [Chat Flow](./chat-flow.md) and [Custom Tools](./custom-tools.md). Two interaction modes:

- **First-turn creation** — describe the intent, get the full structure (title, description, icon, all actions).
- **Revision turns** — *"add an action about pricing"*, *"make the third one shorter"*, *"translate everything to Portuguese"*.

Vibe Coding is especially powerful here because intents are usually authored *en masse* — you're populating the home screen, not writing a one-off. Three minutes of prompting beats two hours of typing.

## Pre-loaded Intents

Turing ES ships with four default intents:

| Intent | Icon | Actions |
|---|---|---|
| **Boost my work productivity** | Briefcase | Create daily schedule, Draft a difficult email, Prepare meeting agenda |
| **Learn something new** | Graduation Cap | Explain complex topics, 30-day study plan, Test my knowledge |
| **Create or improve content** | Pen Tool | Social Media Ideas, Proofread & Enhance, Video Scripting |
| **Health & Mindset** | Heart Pulse | Quick Meditation Guide, Rapid Meal Ideas, At-home Workout |

These can be edited, disabled, or deleted. New intents can be added at any time.

| `GET` | `/api/intent/{id}` | Get a specific intent with its actions |
| `POST` | `/api/intent` | Create a new intent |
| `PUT` | `/api/intent/{id}` | Update an intent |
| `DELETE` | `/api/intent/{id}` | Delete an intent and all its actions |

## Permissions

Intent management uses role-based access control:

| Permission | Description |
|---|---|
| `INTENT_VIEW` | View intent categories |
| `INTENT_CREATE` | Create new intents |
| `INTENT_EDIT` | Edit existing intents |
| `INTENT_DELETE` | Delete intents |

All permissions also require the `ROLE_ADMIN` role.
