description: Run one Turing ES JVM that serves many fully isolated tenants — discriminator-column data isolation, a single Keycloak realm with a tenant claim, tenant-owned infrastructure, plan quotas, and tenant lifecycle.

# Multi-Tenancy

Turing ES can run as a **single JVM process that serves many isolated tenants** (a SaaS / shared-platform deployment), or as a classic **single-tenant install**. The same binary does both — the behavior is controlled by one flag.

:::info One paragraph summary
Tenant data isolation is a **discriminator column**: Hibernate's native `@TenantId` adds the partition column to every insert and a `WHERE tenantId = ?` to every read, driven by a request-scoped current-tenant holder. Identity is a **single Keycloak realm plus a `tenant` claim**; a tenant aggregate and a membership join let one user belong to many tenants. Shared infrastructure (LLM, embedding, store, search-engine, MCP, integration instances) is **tenant-owned — bring-your-own keys — with an optional shared pool**.
:::

## The off-means-legacy guarantee

Everything hides behind **`turing.tenancy.enabled`**, which defaults to `false`.

When the flag is **off**:

- Every request resolves the immutable `DEFAULT` tenant.
- The discriminator becomes a constant equality (`tenantId = 'DEFAULT'`).
- A single-tenant install behaves byte-for-byte as it always has.
- No existing content, search core, secret, or asset needs migration.

This means you can upgrade to a multi-tenancy-capable build with **zero changes** to an existing deployment, and flip the flag on only when you actually need it.

```yaml
turing:
  tenancy:
    enabled: false   # default — single-tenant. Set true for SaaS / shared platform.
```

## How isolation works

The `@TenantId` discriminator column handles the bulk of isolation automatically: once a JPA entity carries it, Hibernate stamps the current tenant on writes and filters reads — application code never writes a tenant `WHERE` clause by hand.

The harder problem is every path that **bypasses the ORM**. Turing closes each one with a dedicated, tenant-aware component:

| Surface | How it's isolated |
|---|---|
| **JPA reads/writes** | `@TenantId` discriminator column on every tenant-owned entity |
| **Distributed cache** (Hazelcast `@Cacheable`) | Cache keys are prefixed with the tenant id |
| **Search-engine cores** (Solr / Elasticsearch) | Name-keyed cores get a `t<shortId>_` prefix |
| **Object storage** (MinIO / filesystem) | Objects live under a `tenants/<id>/` prefix, with path-traversal guards |
| **Lucene vector store** | Vector collections resolve under a per-tenant base path |
| **Secret encryption** | The AES key is derived per tenant: `PBKDF2(master, tenantId)` |
| **Message queue** (Artemis JMS) | Indexing/routine messages carry a tenant header that listeners restore |
| **Scheduled jobs** | Tenant-touching sweeps fan out, running once per active tenant |
| **Reactive / async hops** | The tenant context propagates across thread and reactor boundaries |

:::note UUID-keyed cores don't need a prefix
RAG and intent cores are keyed by globally-unique UUIDs, so they can't collide across tenants. Only cores keyed by a human-chosen name (such as a semantic-navigation site name) are prefixed.
:::

A continuous-integration **isolation suite** (`*Tenant*` tests) is the ship gate: it proves tenant B can't read tenant A's sites, BYO-infrastructure visibility is `current ∪ shared`, and secret crypto is end-to-end tenant-scoped before any SaaS endpoint goes live.

## Tenants & memberships

A **tenant** is the unit of isolation — it has a unique slug, a status (`ACTIVE` / `SUSPENDED`), and a plan. A **membership** joins a user to a tenant with a role:

| Role | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| `OWNER` | Full control of the tenant; created automatically on signup |
| `ADMIN` | Manage the tenant's content and members |
| `MEMBER` | Use the tenant's content |

One user can belong to **many tenants** and switch between them. The `DEFAULT` tenant is immutable and always present — it is the home of all data in single-tenant mode.

---

## Identity & access

Multi-tenancy uses a **single Keycloak realm**. The tenant a request belongs to is resolved per request, in priority order:

1. The `tenant` claim on the JWT
2. The session attribute (set when a user switches tenant)
3. The request subdomain (e.g. `acme.turing.example.com`)
4. The `X-Turing-Tenant` request header

A request for a **suspended** tenant, or from a user with **no active membership**, is rejected with **HTTP 403**. (Platform admins bypass this — see below.)

On successful resolution, Turing grants per-membership authorities of the form `TENANT_<id>` and `TENANT_<id>_<ROLE>`, in both the OIDC and the session-login paths.

### Tenant management endpoints

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/signup` | Self-service: creates a tenant + an `OWNER` membership. Idempotent, slug-validated, reserved words rejected. |
| `GET /api/tenants/mine` | List the tenants the current user belongs to. |
| `POST /api/tenants/{slug}/switch` | Switch the current session's active tenant. |
| `GET/POST /api/platform/tenants/**` | Platform-admin only: list, suspend, activate, impersonate. |

### Platform administrators

`ROLE_PLATFORM_ADMIN` is the **only sanctioned way to cross tenant boundaries**. Cross-tenant operations go through an audited platform-admin service (`runForTenant` / `runAsSystem`); every such access is logged. Application code never reads another tenant's data directly.

---

## Tenant-owned infrastructure (bring-your-own keys)

LLM instances, embedding models, embedding stores, search-engine instances, MCP servers, and integrations are **tenant-owned**. Each of these carries an optional tenant id:

- A row scoped to a tenant id is **private** to that tenant (its own API keys, its own endpoints).
- A row with **no** tenant id is a **shared / platform-provided global** instance, visible to every tenant.

Repository queries return `current tenant ∪ shared` (`tenantId = :t OR tenantId IS NULL`). Only a platform admin may create a `null`-tenant global instance. This lets a SaaS operator offer a shared default model *and* let each tenant plug in their own provider keys.

---

## Plans & quotas

A tenant's **plan** maps to limits enforced at runtime:

- The `FREE` plan is **bounded** (capped resources / spend).
- Paid and custom plans are **unlimited**.

Enforcement points:

| Limit hit at | Response |
|---|---|
| Resource creation over quota | **HTTP 402** Payment Required |
| LLM call admission over quota | **HTTP 429** Too Many Requests |

Per-tenant **cost attribution** rolls up token usage by tenant, feeding the live AI-spend dashboard (see [Token Usage](./token-usage.md)).

---

## Tenant lifecycle & teardown

Tenant teardown is platform-admin only, **audited**, and **idempotent**:

- **Suspend** — flips status to `SUSPENDED`. The resolution filter then blocks the tenant's members (403) without destroying any data, so suspension is fully reversible (**Activate** flips it back).
- **Delete** — supports a `dryRun` mode that returns the deletion *plan* without mutating anything. A real delete purges the storage prefix, removes the Lucene vector directory, evicts caches, and removes the membership + tenant rows. The tenant's `@TenantId` content becomes **unreachable immediately**, because the resolver never again yields a deleted tenant id.

:::warning Engine-side cleanup is a runbook step
A physical database row sweep, dropping external Solr/Elasticsearch cores, and Keycloak attribute cleanup require the live engines and are deployment-specific operational steps that run alongside the in-app delete.

## Adding a tenant-safe entity (for developers)

If you extend Turing with a new persistent entity, decide which kind it is:

1. **Tenant-owned content** (a tenant's own data — like a site or an agent): add a `@TenantId` discriminator column. Add it to the schema as nullable with a `DEFAULT` default value, backfill existing NULLs to `DEFAULT`, then flip it `NOT NULL` in a follow-up migration. Hibernate handles stamping and filtering from there.

2. **Shared infrastructure** (BYO keys with a global pool): add a **plain** nullable tenant id (not `@TenantId`) and a `findVisibleToTenant` query that returns `tenantId = :t OR tenantId IS NULL`. Gate creation of `null`-tenant globals on `ROLE_PLATFORM_ADMIN`.

3. **Out-of-band resource** (a new cache, core, storage path, or queue): prefix it with the current tenant using the matching component, and add a negative assertion to the isolation suite.

4. **Never** read across tenants except through the audited platform-admin service.

---

## Escalation seam (shared → schema → database)

Every tenant carries an `isolationMode` of `SHARED`, `SCHEMA`, or `DB` (default `SHARED`). This reserves a future migration path to move a heavy enterprise tenant onto a dedicated schema or database — via a pluggable Hibernate tenant connection provider — without changing the data model. **Only `SHARED` is implemented today**; the field exists so the escalation path requires no schema rewrite later.
