# Tool Calling

A **Tool Calling** is a function that the LLM can invoke autonomously during a conversation to retrieve information or perform an action. Instead of relying purely on training data, the LLM calls tools to fetch live data, search indexed content, execute code, and more — then incorporates the results into its reasoning.

Turing ES includes native tools organized into categories, plus support for external tools via [MCP Servers](./mcp-servers.md). Tools are enabled per [AI Agent](./ai-agents.md) — each agent selects only the tools it needs.

## DSL Search — 6 tools

These tools provide **Elasticsearch-compatible Query DSL** access to any Semantic Navigation Site. Inspired by the [Elasticsearch MCP Server](https://github.com/elastic/mcp-server-elasticsearch), they allow the LLM to build and execute full DSL queries, aggregations, and analytics — automatically translated to the site's configured search engine (Elasticsearch, Solr, or Lucene).

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `dsl_list_indices` | Lists all available SN Sites with engine type, locales, and status |
| `dsl_get_mappings` | Returns field mappings (types, facets, multi-valued) in Elasticsearch format |
| `dsl_search` | Executes a full Elasticsearch Query DSL search (40 query types, 35 aggregations) |
| `dsl_get_document` | Retrieves a document by ID with all stored fields |
| `dsl_suggest` | Autocomplete suggestions and spell-check corrections |
| `dsl_get_shards` | Shard/core information: document counts, engine type, endpoints, locales |

### How the LLM uses DSL tools

The LLM follows a pattern similar to how a developer uses the Elasticsearch API:

1. **Discover** → `dsl_list_indices("*")` to find available sites
2. **Understand schema** → `dsl_get_mappings("mySite")` to see fields and types
3. **Search** → `dsl_search("mySite", "en", queryBody)` with full DSL
4. **Deep dive** → `dsl_get_document("mySite", "en", "doc-123")` for full content
5. **Correct typos** → `dsl_suggest("mySite", "en", "enterprse")` for corrections

### The `dsl_search` tool

This is the most powerful tool. The `queryBody` parameter accepts the complete Elasticsearch `_search` request body as a JSON string. The LLM constructs the query based on the user's intent:

**Simple search:**
```json
{"query":{"match":{"title":"machine learning"}},"size":5}
```

**Filtered search with aggregations:**
```json
{
  "query":{"bool":{"must":[{"match":{"title":"security"}}],"filter":[{"term":{"type":"article"}}]}},
  "size":10,
  "aggs":{"by_author":{"terms":{"field":"author","size":5}}},
  "highlight":{"fields":{"title":{},"body":{}}}
}
```

**Date range with sorting:**
```json
{
  "query":{"range":{"date":{"gte":"2025-01-01"}}},
  "sort":[{"date":"desc"}],
  "size":20
}
```

**Similar documents (More Like This):**
```json
{"query":{"more_like_this":{"fields":["title","body"],"like":"enterprise search platform","min_term_freq":1}}}
```

**Facet value discovery (terms aggregation):**
```json
{"query":{"match_all":{}},"size":0,"aggs":{"categories":{"terms":{"field":"category","size":50}}}}
```

For the complete DSL reference, see [DSL Query API](./dsl-query.md) and [DSL Compatibility Matrix](./dsl-compatibility.md).

### Prompt examples

- *"Search for documents about authentication in the Sample site"* → `dsl_search` with `match` query
- *"What fields can I filter by on the Sample site?"* → `dsl_get_mappings`
- *"Show me the full content of document ID abc-123"* → `dsl_get_document`
- *"How many documents do we have per content type?"* → `dsl_search` with `terms` aggregation
- *"Find documents similar to the article about Solr configuration"* → `dsl_search` with `more_like_this`
- *"What articles were updated in the last 7 days about security?"* → `dsl_search` with `range` + `sort`
- *"Compare the features of Product A and Product B"* → `dsl_get_document` called for each product
- *"What categories are available?"* → `dsl_search` with `size:0` and `terms` aggregation
- *"How many documents per locale does the site have?"* → `dsl_get_shards`

## RAG / Knowledge Base — 4 tools

These tools enable the LLM to query the **Knowledge Base** — files indexed from MinIO via the [Assets](./assets.md) section — using semantic similarity search.

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `search_knowledge_base` | Searches for relevant documents by semantic similarity (top 10, threshold 0.7) |
| `knowledge_base_stats` | Returns statistics: total files, chunks, and storage size |
| `list_knowledge_base_files` | Lists all indexed files, with optional keyword filter |
| `get_file_from_knowledge_base` | Retrieves the full indexed content of a specific file |

**Prompt examples:**

- *"What does our internal documentation say about deployment procedures?"* → triggers `search_knowledge_base`
- *"How many files are indexed in the knowledge base?"* → triggers `knowledge_base_stats`
- *"Show me the full content of the file onboarding-guide.pdf"* → triggers `list_knowledge_base_files` then `get_file_from_knowledge_base`

---

## Web Crawler — 2 tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `fetch_webpage` | Fetches a web page by URL and returns its content as plain text |
| `extract_links` | Extracts all links from a web page, with optional keyword filter |

**Prompt examples:**

- *"What does the Apache Solr documentation say about faceted search?"* → triggers `fetch_webpage`
- *"List all links on our company blog homepage"* → triggers `extract_links`

---

## Finance — 2 tools

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_stock_quote` | Current price and market data for a stock ticker symbol |
| `search_ticker` | Looks up a ticker symbol by company name or keyword |

**Prompt examples:**

- *"What is the current stock price of Apple?"* → triggers `search_ticker` then `get_stock_quote`
- *"Show me the market data for MSFT"* → triggers `get_stock_quote`

---

## Weather — 1 tool

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_weather` | Current weather and forecast for a city (1–7 day range) |

**Prompt examples:**

- *"What's the weather forecast for São Paulo this week?"* → triggers `get_weather`

---

## Image Search — 1 tool

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `search_images` | Searches the web for images and returns URLs and descriptions |

**Prompt examples:**

- *"Find images of enterprise search architecture diagrams"* → triggers `search_images`

---

## DateTime — 1 tool

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `get_current_time` | Returns the current date and time for a given IANA timezone |

**Prompt examples:**

- *"What time is it right now in Tokyo?"* → triggers `get_current_time`

---

## Code Interpreter — 1 tool

| Tool | Description |
|---|---|
| `execute_python` | Executes Python code in a sandboxed environment and returns stdout/stderr |

The Code Interpreter runs Python in an isolated sandbox directory with a **30-second execution timeout**. It supports:

- Standard output capture
- Matplotlib chart generation (with `Agg` backend — no display required)
- Automatic `print()` wrapping for bare expressions

The Python executable path is configured in **Administration → Settings → Python Path**.

**Prompt examples:**

- *"Calculate the compound interest on $10,000 at 5% for 10 years"* → triggers `execute_python`
- *"Generate a bar chart showing monthly sales: Jan=100, Feb=150, Mar=120"* → triggers `execute_python` with matplotlib

### Execution modes: NATIVE vs DOCKER

You choose how Python actually runs in **Console → Global Settings → Code Interpreter**:

| Mode | What it is | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **NATIVE** (default) | A host subprocess running the configured Python | Trusted content, simplest setup |
| **DOCKER** | Each execution runs in a fresh, hardened container | Untrusted input, multi-tenant, defense-in-depth |

**DOCKER** is the recommended posture when code might be influenced by untrusted input. Every execution gets a throwaway container with baseline hardening always applied — `--cap-drop ALL`, `--no-new-privileges`, `--read-only`, and Docker's built-in seccomp profile — plus configurable limits under `turing.code-interpreter.docker.*`:

| Key | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `network` | `none` | `none` = **no egress**; or a named docker network |
| `memory` | `512m` | hard RAM cap per execution |
| `cpus` | `1.0` | CPU quota per execution |
| `pids-limit` | `128` | max PIDs (fork-bomb containment) |
| `runtime` | (host default) | set `runsc` for **gVisor** extra isolation (opt-in) |
| `seccomp-profile` | (Docker default) | path to a tighter seccomp profile (opt-in) |

A **"Check Docker"** probe in Global Settings verifies the daemon is reachable before you switch.

### Resource limits for the NATIVE path

DOCKER caps via the container runtime; the NATIVE path can stop a runaway script (e.g. `[x*x for x in range(10**9)]`) from exhausting host RAM before the timeout fires. Opt in under `turing.code-interpreter.native.limits` (Linux only):

```yaml
turing:
  code-interpreter:
    native:
      limits:
        enabled: true       # default false (timeout is the only guard)
        memory-max: 1g       # hard RAM cap
        cpu-seconds: 35      # CPU-time cap
        limiter: auto        # auto | prlimit | systemd-run | none
```

### Warm pool (NATIVE only)

A frequently-invoked tool pays a ~200ms cold-boot each call. Enable a pre-warmed pool of single-use interpreters to skip it:

```yaml
turing:
  code-interpreter:
    warm-pool:
      enabled: true   # default false
      size: 2          # interpreters kept booted and ready
```

Workers are **single-use** (one execution then exit — no cross-tenant state leak) and refilled asynchronously. The pool is automatically bypassed in DOCKER mode and whenever the NATIVE limits above are enabled (a pooled worker can't be wrapped by `prlimit`/`systemd-run`).

### Structured output & `sandbox:` URLs

Beyond stdout/stderr, the interpreter can return a **structured result** — used by [Custom Tools](./custom-tools.md) via the Groovy `code.executePythonStructured(...)` / `code.executePythonJson(...)` bindings. It carries `stdout`, `stderr`, an `exitCode`, `timedOut`, `durationMs`, a rendered `markdown`, and a list of generated **files** (`name`, `url`, `image`, `sizeBytes`). Files (a chart PNG, a generated PDF) are addressed with Turing's **`sandbox:` URL scheme** (the OpenAI convention) — clients resolve them to a real download URL, and the underlying `/api/v2/code-interpreter/{session}/{file}` URLs are **HMAC-signed and cookie-bound** so they can't be replayed across browsers. This retires the old "regex-parse the markdown for file links" approach.

Agents can also declare extra Python dependencies (e.g. `reportlab matplotlib qrcode`) that Turing ensures are installed before running.

:::tip Tool output feeding a slot
A Code Interpreter file can land in a **multi-modal slot**. Slot types `IMAGE` / `AUDIO` / `FILE` hold an artifact's storage URL, so a generated chart or document becomes a first-class value in a [Chat Flow](./chat-flow.md#slots-the-conversations-memory).

## External Tools via MCP Servers

Beyond the native tools, AI Agents can access tools from any external server implementing the **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**. This covers company-internal systems, proprietary data APIs, and the growing ecosystem of public MCP servers.

See [MCP Servers](./mcp-servers.md) for configuration details.

---

## Large results are offloaded automatically

Some tools return a lot — a big search dump, a long catalog, a wide JSON array. Pasting all of that into the prompt every turn is wasteful. When a tool result exceeds `turing.genai.tool-result-offload.inline-max-chars` (default **4096**), Turing writes the full payload to the [Agent Workspace](./agent-workspace.md) and replaces the inline result with a short `workspace://…` reference. The model pulls the data back **only when it needs it**, via an always-present `workspace_read` tool.

This applies uniformly to native, MCP, and [Custom](./custom-tools.md) tools, and is active only when a [storage backend](./configuration-reference.md#storage) is configured — so the default deployment behaves exactly as before. See [Agent Workspace → Auto-offload](./agent-workspace.md#2-auto-offload-of-large-tool-results) for details.
