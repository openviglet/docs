# Skills

> *A Custom Tool teaches an agent one function. An MCP server connects it to one system. A **Skill** packages a whole capability — instructions, scripts, reference material, and the runtime to execute them — into one portable folder that runs the same way in Claude **and** in Turing ES.*

A **Skill** is an [Anthropic-compatible](https://www.anthropic.com/news/skills) folder: a `SKILL.md` file at the root (with YAML frontmatter), optionally accompanied by `scripts/`, `references/`, and `assets/`. You author it like a mini project, store it in object storage, and Turing runs it inside a **Docker sandbox that is compatible with Anthropic's skill container**.

The whole point is **portability**. The same folder you build in Turing runs unmodified in Claude, and any skill ZIP you export from Claude imports straight into Turing. Turing becomes an *entry and exit door* for the broader skills ecosystem — not a fork of it.

Three things distinguish a Skill from the other ways of extending an agent:

1. **It carries its own runtime.** Unlike a [Custom Tool](./custom-tools.md) (one Groovy function) or an [MCP server](./mcp-servers.md) (a remote tool surface), a Skill bundles *instructions + executable scripts + reference docs* and runs them in a real Linux container with `bash`, Python, and Node.
2. **It activates progressively.** The LLM doesn't pay for the skill's full content up front. It sees only the name and description, then loads the body on demand, then runs commands in the sandbox — three levels, each more expensive than the last, opened only when needed.
3. **It's portable across the ecosystem.** Import any Anthropic skill ZIP; export any Turing skill folder as an Anthropic-compatible ZIP. One ZIP can carry many skills, each an independent, separately activatable unit.

Manage skills in **Administration → Skills**.

:::info Requirements
Skills are a **gated** feature. They are available only when **all three** of the following are true:

- A [storage backend](./configuration-reference.md#storage) is configured (`turing.storage.type` ≠ `none`) — this is where skill folders live.
- The [Code Interpreter](./tool-calling.md#code-interpreter--1-tool) execution mode is set to **`DOCKER`** — a `bash` session with no container is exactly the escape vector containerization closes, so there is **no native fallback**.
- A **Default LLM** is configured and enabled in Global Settings — every skill runs on it (see [Why a skill always runs on the Default LLM](#why-a-skill-always-runs-on-the-default-llm)).

When any of these is missing, the feature is a complete no-op — prompts and agents behave byte-for-byte as if Skills did not exist.

## Anatomy of a Skill

A Skill is just a folder. The only required file is `SKILL.md` at the root; everything else is optional and addressed by the instructions inside it.

```
brand-content-studio/
├── SKILL.md              ← required: frontmatter + instructions
├── references/           ← reference docs the model reads on demand
│   └── tone-of-voice.md
├── scripts/              ← executable helpers (python, bash, node…)
│   └── render_banner.py
└── assets/               ← static files (templates, fonts, logos…)
    └── logo.svg
```

### `SKILL.md` frontmatter

The frontmatter is YAML between `---` fences. Turing parses it (leniently — a malformed file never crashes the catalog) to build the thin index row:

```markdown
---
name: Brand Content Studio
description: Generates on-brand marketing copy and banner images from a campaign brief. Use when the user asks for branded content, social posts, or campaign assets.
version: 1.0.0
author: Marketing Team
---

# Brand Content Studio

You are a brand content specialist. When the user provides a campaign brief:

1. Read `references/tone-of-voice.md` for the voice guidelines.
2. Draft the copy following those guidelines.
3. To render a banner, run `python scripts/render_banner.py --text "..."`.
   The output PNG lands in `/workspace`; return its URL to the user.
...
```

| Field | Source | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | frontmatter `name` | Display name + the identity the LLM sees at level 1 |
| `description` | frontmatter `description` | **The single most important field** — it's what the LLM uses to decide whether to activate the skill. Write it like an LLM Description: concrete, with *"Use when…"* triggers. |
| `version` | top-level `version`, else `metadata.version` | Informational version string |
| `author` | top-level `author`, else first of `metadata.authors` | Informational author string |

Everything except the **enabled** toggle is derived from the folder — the database holds only a thin catalog index (`id, name, description, version, author, path, enabled`). The folder in storage is the source of truth; the index is rebuilt from it.

### The body is the instructions

Below the frontmatter, the Markdown body is the skill's actual operating instructions — the procedure the model follows once it activates the skill. It can reference other files in the folder (`references/…`, `scripts/…`) and tell the model to run them in the sandbox.

---

## How a Skill activates: progressive disclosure

A skill can be large — thousands of words of instructions, plus scripts and reference docs. Loading all of that into every prompt would be wasteful. Instead, Turing exposes a skill in **three levels**, each opened only when the model decides it's worth it.

| Level | What the model sees | Cost | Opened by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1 — Metadata** | Each offered skill's `name` + `description` only, plus the activation protocol | Cheap — always in the prompt | Automatic (system prompt block) |
| **2 — Instructions** | The full `SKILL.md` body for one chosen skill | Medium — one tool call | `load_skill` tool |
| **3 — Execution** | A live `bash` session in the skill's Docker sandbox | Expensive — container run per command | `skill_bash` tool |

The model reads the descriptions (level 1), decides a skill is relevant, calls `load_skill` to read its instructions (level 2), then drives `skill_bash` to run the skill's scripts and produce artifacts (level 3). This mirrors how Claude itself activates skills.

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `load_skill` | Returns the chosen skill's full `SKILL.md` body on demand |
| `skill_bash` | Runs a `bash` command inside the skill's sandbox; returns stdout/stderr |

Both tools are **constrained to the offered set** for that turn — the model can't load or execute a skill that wasn't put on the table.

---

## The sandbox: where a Skill runs

A skill executes in a Docker sandbox built to be compatible with Anthropic's skill container. Two paths are mounted into every session:

| Mount | Mode | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `/skill` | **read-only** | The skill folder, materialized from storage — `SKILL.md`, `scripts/`, `references/`, `assets/` |
| `/workspace` | **read-write** | A persistent [workspace](./agent-workspace.md) — the skill writes its outputs (files, charts, exports) here, and they survive across turns |

The session is keyed by `(agentId, conversationId, skillId)`, so a warm conversation keeps its `/workspace` between turns while a fresh conversation gets a clean one.

:::info The container is ephemeral; the filesystem is not
Each `skill_bash` call spawns a **fresh, hardened `docker run … bash -lc <cmd>`** — not a long-lived container. It runs with `--network none`, memory/CPU/PID limits, `--cap-drop ALL`, `--security-opt no-new-privileges`, a read-only root filesystem, and a tmpfs `/tmp`; `/workspace` is the only writable mount. The filesystem *persists across turns* because the bind-mounted **host** directory is stable — not because any container stays alive. This is the same hardening posture as the [Code Interpreter](./tool-calling.md#code-interpreter--1-tool) DOCKER path.
:::

Idle session directories are reaped by modification time, so an active conversation keeps its work while abandoned ones are cleaned up.

## Using Skills in Chat

Attach skills to an [AI Agent](./ai-agents.md) with the **Skills** toggle in the agent settings (`skillsEnabled`, shown only when the feature is available). Once enabled, every enabled skill in the catalog is offered to that agent's conversations via progressive disclosure.

### Why a skill always runs on the Default LLM

A skill is **portable** — it should behave identically no matter which agent or site invokes it. So Turing runs every skill on the **Global Settings Default LLM**, *never* on the calling agent's own model. A skill authored against one model's behavior keeps that behavior everywhere.

### The `run_skill` delegation

A tool can't switch the model that's driving it. So Turing uses a **delegated sub-loop**:

1. The **parent turn** (running on the agent's own model) sees only the cheap level-1 block — each skill's name + description — plus a single `run_skill(skill, task)` tool.
2. When the model calls `run_skill`, Turing spins up a **sub-conversation on the Default LLM**. That sub-loop gets the full activation harness — the `SKILL.md` system prompt, `load_skill`, and `skill_bash` — and runs to completion.
3. The sub-loop's result text is handed back to the parent turn as the tool result.

The parent model orchestrates; the Default LLM executes the skill. Token usage for the sub-loop is recorded separately.

### Skill mode: pin one skill for a conversation

By default the agent is offered **all** enabled skills (the model picks). You can also pin **one** skill for a conversation — a distinct "mode" — using the **Skill mode** selector beside the flow selector in the chat console:

- **Auto / all skills** (default) — legacy progressive disclosure across the whole catalog.
- **A specific skill** — only that skill is offered; the model can't silently widen to others.

Under the hood this is an optional `selectedSkillId` on the chat request. A blank value means *all enabled skills*; an id or a case-insensitive name pins exactly one; an unknown or disabled pin offers nothing (a pinned mode never falls back to the full catalog).

---

## Using Skills in Semantic Navigation

Skills work in [Semantic Navigation](./semantic-navigation.md) AI chat too — and you don't configure anything extra. SN AI chat shares the same execution path as agent chat, so the agent's `skillsEnabled` toggle activates skills in SN mode automatically, still on the Default LLM.

There's one addition unique to the skill sub-loop: it's also given **Turing's own search tools**. The Semantic Navigation DSL toolset — `dsl_list_indices`, `dsl_get_mappings`, `dsl_search`, `dsl_get_document`, `dsl_suggest`, `dsl_get_shards` (the same surface the [DSL Query](./dsl-query.md) chat exposes) — is available to the skill alongside `load_skill` and `skill_bash`. These run in-process (no container network); the model bridges their results into the sandbox `/workspace` via `skill_bash`.

This is the first place a skill can leverage Turing's *own* indexed data: search the enterprise content with standard tools, then process the results with the skill's scripts.

---

## Authoring Skills: the mini editor

Skills are authored in a built-in **mini-VS-Code** editor at **Administration → Skills** (`/admin/skill`). The list page shows skills by name; click one to open the editor.

- **File tree** on the left, reconstructed from the skill's folder, rooted at the skill itself — you can't navigate above the skill root.
- **CodeMirror editor** on the right, with syntax highlighting per file extension (Python, JavaScript, shell, YAML, XML, CSS; Markdown and unknown types as plain text).
- Create files and folders, rename, delete, and save — all scoped safely to the skill root (paths are validated so the editor can never escape into other storage).

Saving or deleting a `SKILL.md` automatically **reindexes** the catalog so the name/description/version stay in sync with the folder.

### Import & export

Skills round-trip as standard ZIP archives:

- **Import ZIP** — drop in an archive and each top-level folder that contains a `SKILL.md` becomes its **own** indexed skill. A root-level `SKILL.md` is treated as one skill. (`__MACOSX` and hidden entries are skipped.) This is how one ZIP carries many independent skills.
- **Export → ZIP** — every file in a skill is wrapped under one top-level `{slug}/` folder, producing an Anthropic-compatible archive that round-trips back through import unchanged.

Because import splits each `SKILL.md`-bearing folder into a separate catalog row, a multi-skill bundle behaves as a set of **independent, separately activatable units** — not a monolith.

---

## The catalog & reindexing

The database holds a **thin index**, not the skill content. `reindex` walks the immediate child folders under `turing.storage.skillsPath` (default `skills/`), reads each `<folder>/SKILL.md`, and upserts a catalog row by folder path:

- The folder **path** is the unique identity.
- Reindexing **preserves** the `enabled` flag and `id`; everything else is re-derived from frontmatter.
- Rows whose folder lost its `SKILL.md` are pruned — storage is the truth, the index is reconciled to it.

There is no manual *delete* on the index; remove the folder (or its `SKILL.md`) and reindex.

---

## Configuration

| Setting | Where | Default | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `turing.storage.type` | `application.yaml` | `none` | Must be `minio` or `filesystem` — skill folders are stored here |
| `turing.storage.skillsPath` | `application.yaml` | `skills` | Storage prefix under which skill folders live |
| Code Interpreter mode | Global Settings | `NATIVE` | Must be **`DOCKER`** for skills to run |
| `GLOBAL_CODE_INTERPRETER_SKILL_IMAGE` | Global Settings | `python:3.12-slim` | The Docker image for skill sandboxes (needs `python` + `node` + `bash`). Shown only in DOCKER mode. |
| Default LLM | Global Settings | — | The model every skill runs on |
| Skills toggle | per AI Agent | off | `skillsEnabled` — activates skills for that agent/SN site |

The feature flag `skillsEnabled` (equal to *storage enabled*) drives the **Skills** sidebar item and the agent toggle visibility in the admin console.

|---|---|---|
| `GET` | `/api/skill` | List all skills (catalog index) |
| `GET` | `/api/skill/{id}` | Get a single skill |
| `GET` | `/api/skill/{id}/skill-md` | Get the raw `SKILL.md` (text/markdown) |
| `POST` | `/api/skill` | Create a new skill (writes a starter `SKILL.md`) |
| `POST` | `/api/skill/reindex` | Re-scan storage and reconcile the catalog |
| `PUT` | `/api/skill/{id}/enabled?value=` | Enable / disable a skill |
| `GET` | `/api/skill/{id}/files` | List the skill's files (paths relative to root) |

## SDK support

Both SDKs accept a `selectedSkillId` to pin skill mode for a chat:

- **`@viglet/turing-sdk`** and **`@viglet/turing-react-sdk`** — `selectedSkillId` on `PostAgentChatOptions`.
- **`useTuringChat`** — `selectedSkillId` on `UseTuringChatOptions`.

Leaving it blank keeps the legacy behavior (all enabled skills offered). See the [React SDK](./react-sdk.md) reference.

## Skills vs. Custom Tools vs. MCP

All three extend an agent, but they sit at different scales:

| | [Custom Tool](./custom-tools.md) | [MCP Server](./mcp-servers.md) | **Skill** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shape** | One Groovy function | A remote tool surface | A folder: instructions + scripts + references |
| **Runtime** | Sandboxed JVM/Groovy | The MCP server's own process | A hardened Docker container (`bash`, Python, Node) |
| **Best for** | A small, deterministic computation or API call | Connecting to a live external system | A multi-step capability with its own procedure and helper scripts |
| **Portability** | Turing-specific | Protocol-portable | **Ecosystem-portable** — runs identically in Claude |
| **How the LLM uses it** | Picks the function by description | Picks an MCP tool by description | Activates progressively (metadata → instructions → execution) |

Reach for a Skill when the work is a *whole capability* — "generate on-brand campaign assets", "produce a financial model from a CSV" — that benefits from packaged instructions, bundled scripts, and a real execution environment, and that you might want to share with or import from the wider skills ecosystem.
