* Installing and configuring the PostgreSQL Database

[[configuring-databases-postgresql-database]]
===== Installing and configuring the PostgreSQL Database
This section describes the steps required to install and configure a PostgreSQL database for your Shio CMS environment. You will also need to configure the Shio user, database and schemas.

To install the PostgreSQL database:

1. Navigate to the following URL and follow the instructions provided for your supported version of PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/

To configure the PostgreSQL instance:

* Open the postgresql.conf file (located in <PostgreSQL_installDir>\<version>\data\) and set the following parameters:

[source,ini]
----
max_connections = 10
max_prepared_transactions = 10
shared_buffers = 512MB
autovacuum = off
----

IMPORTANT:  The autovacuum daemon is used to reclaim memory/storage space the database is no longer using. You must re-enable this utility after you have finished installing and configuring Shio CMS.

NOTE: Configuration values will vary for higher transaction environments and numbers of users.
max_prepared_transactions should be at least as large as max_connections so that every session can have a prepared transaction pending.

[[configuring-databases-postgresql-configuring-user-database-schemas]]
===== Configuring the Shio user, database, and schemas
This section discusses the steps required to configure the users, database and schemas for your Shio CMS environment.

NOTE: You must be a PostgreSQL super-user or have createuser privileges to create Shio users. To create and configure the Shio CMS database, you must be a super-user or have create privileges.

IMPORTANT: When you create a database table in PostgreSQL, the field name must be lowercase.

To configure the Shio CMS user:

1. Create a user as the owner of the Shio CMS database:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE USER shio PASSWORD <password> with createuser;
----

1. Create a Shio CMS database:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE shio_db;
ALTER DATABASE shio_db OWNER TO shio;
----

To create and access the Shio CMS user and schema:

* Log in to the shio (database) using the shio account. For example, on the operating system command prompt:

[source,bash]
----
$psql -U shio -d shio_db
----

* Create the Shio schema and grant ownership to the Shio user:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE SCHEMA shio;
ALTER SCHEMA shio OWNER TO shio;
----

* Set the PostgreSQL search_path variable to the user to allow direct access to the respective schemas:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER USER shio SET SEARCH_PATH = shio;
----
