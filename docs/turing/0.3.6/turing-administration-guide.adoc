= Preface

Viglet Turing AI (https://viglet.com/turing) is an open source solution (https://github.com/openturing), which has Semantic Navigation and Chatbot as its main features. You can choose from several NLPs to enrich the data. All content is indexed in Solr as search engine.

== NLP

Turing support the followings providers:

=== OpenNLP
Apache OpenNLP is a machine learning based toolkit for the processing of natural language text.

Website: https://opennlp.apache.org/

=== OpenText Content Analytics
It transforms data into insights for better decision-making and information management while freeing up resources and time.

Website: https://www.opentext.com/

=== CoreNLP
CoreNLP is your one stop shop for natural language processing in Java! CoreNLP enables users to derive linguistic annotations for text, including token and sentence boundaries, parts of speech, named entities, numeric and time values, dependency and constituency parses, coreference, sentiment, quote attributions, and relations. CoreNLP currently supports 6 languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, and Spanish.

Website: https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/,

=== SpaCy
It is a free open-source library for Natural Language Processing in Python. It features NER, POS tagging, dependency parsing, word vectors and more.

Website: https://spacy.io

=== Polyglot NLP
Polyglot is a natural language pipeline that supports massive multilingual applications.

Website: https://polyglot.readthedocs.io

== Documents and OCR

It can read PDFs and Documents and convert to plain text and also it uses OCR to detect text in images and images into documents.

== Semantic Navigation

=== Connectors

Semantic Navigation uses Connectors to index the content from many sources.

==== Apache Nutch
Plugin for Apache Nutch to index content using crawler.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#nutch

==== Database
Command line that uses the same concept as sqoop (https://sqoop.apache.org/), to create complex queries and map attributes to index based on the result.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#database

==== File System
Command line to index files, extracting text from files such as Word, Excel, PDF, including images, through OCR.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#file-system

==== OpenText WEM Listener
OpenText WEM Listener to publish content to Viglet Turing.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#wem

==== Wordpress
Wordpress plugin that allows you to index posts.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#wordpress

=== Named Entity Recognition (NER)
With NLP it is possible to detect entities such as:

* People
* Places
* Organizations
* Money
* Time
* Percentage

=== Facets
Define attributes that will be used as filters for your navigation, consolidating the total content in your display

=== Targeting Rules
Through attributes defined in the contents, it is possible to use them to restrict their display based on the user's profile.

=== SDK Java
Java API (https://github.com/openturing/turing-java-sdk) facilitates the use and access to Viglet Turing AI, without the need for consumer search content with complex queries.

== Chatbot
Communicate with your client and elaborate complex intents, obtain reports and progressively evolve your interaction.

Its components:

=== Agent
Handles conversations with your end users. It is a natural language processing module that understands the nuances of human language

=== Intent
An intent categorizes an end user's intention for taking a conversation shift. For each agent, you define several intents, where your combined intents can handle a complete conversation.

=== Actions
The field of action is a simple field of convenience that helps to execute logic in the service.

=== Entity
Each intent parameter has a type, called an entity type, that dictates exactly how the data in an end user expression is extracted.

=== Training
Defines and corrects intents.

=== History
Shows the conversation history and reports.

== OpenText Blazon Integration

Turing AI detects Entities of OpenText Blazon Documents using OCR and NLP, generating Blazon XML to show the entities into document.

== Customer Case Studies

=== Brazil
==== Insurance Company
On Intranet of Insurance Company uses OpenText WEM and OpenText Portal integrated with Dynamic Portal Module, a consolidated search was created in Viglet Turing AI, using the connectors: WEM, Database with File System. In this way it was possible to display all the contents and files of the search Intranet, with targeting rules, allowing only to display content that the user has permission. The OpenText Portal accesses Viglet Turing AI Java API, so it was not necessary to create complex queries to return the results.

==== Government Company
A set of API Rest was created to make all Government Company content available to partners. All these contents are in OpenText WEM and the WEM connector was used to index the contents on Viglet Turing AI. A Spring Boot application was created with the Rest API set that consumes Turing AI content through the Viglet Turing AI Java API.

==== University
Brazilian University website was developed using Viglet Shio CMS (https://viglet.com/shio), and all contents are indexed in Viglet Turing AI automatically. This configuration was made in content modeling and the development of the search template was made in Viglet Shio CMS.

=== Spanish
==== Insurance Company
Institutional website of the insurance company using OpenText Dynamic Site Module with multi languages, an integrated search was created with Turing AI, using connectors: WEM and Apache Nutch.
