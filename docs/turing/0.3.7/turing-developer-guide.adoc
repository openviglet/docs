[preface]
== Preface

Viglet Turing AI (https://viglet.com/turing) is an open source solution (https://github.com/openturing), which has Semantic Navigation and Chatbot as its main features. You can choose from several NLPs to enrich the data. All content is indexed in Solr as search engine.

== More Documentation

Technical documentation on Turing AI is available at https://docs.viglet.com/turing.

== Development Structure

=== Frameworks
Turing AI was developed using Spring Boot (https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) for its backend.

The UI is currently using AngularJS (https://angularjs.org), but a new UI is being developed using Angular 12 (https://angular.io) with Primer CSS (https://primer.style/css).

In addition to Java, you also need to have Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

=== Databases
By default it uses the H2 database (https://www.h2database.com), but can be changed to other databases using Spring Boot properties. It comes bundled with OpenNLP (https://opennlp.apache.org/) in the same JVM.

=== Language and Deploy
It uses Java 14 (https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk14&jvmVariant=hotspot) and its deployment is done with Gradle 7.2 (https://gradle.org/) and works on Linux and Windows.

=== Docker
To use Semantic Navigation and Chatbot you must have a Solr (https://solr.apache.org) service available. If you prefer to work with all the services Turing depends on, you can use docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) to start these services, we use the Docker Desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on computer.

=== IDE
You can use Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse (https://spring.io/tools) or Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) or IntelliJ (https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/) as IDEs.

== Download

Use the git command line to download the repository to your computer.

=== Turing Server and Connectors

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openturing/turing.git 
```
=== Turing Java SDK

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openturing/turing-java-sdk.git
```

== Run during Development

To run Turing AI, execute the following lines:

=== Turing Server

==== Development

===== With UI
```shell
cd turing 
./gradlew turing-app:bootrun
```

===== Without update UI
```shell
cd turing 
./gradlew turing-app:bootrun -Pno-ui
```

==== New Turing UI

Start the Turing Server using dev-ui profile
```shell
cd turing 
./gradlew turing-app:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-ui' -Pno-ui
```

And start one of the components of turing-ui
```shell
cd turing/turing-ui

## Console
ng serve console

## Search
ng serve sn

## Chatbot
ng serve converse

## Chatbot
ng serve welcome
```
IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first.

==== Build
```shell
cd turing 
./gradlew turing-app:build
```

=== Java SDK
==== Development
```shell
cd turing-java-sdk
./gradlew shadowJar
java -cp build/libs/turing-java-sdk-all.jar com.viglet.turing.client.sn.sample.TurSNClientSample
```
IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first.

=== Build
```shell
cd turing-java-sdk
./gradlew build
```
Or use the jitpack into your project at https://jitpack.io/#openturing/turing-java-sdk

=== WEM Listener

```shell
cd turing
./gradlew turing-wem:shadowJar
```
For development, copy the turing-wem/build/libs/turing-wem-all.jar into WEM_DIR/libs and test the listener using turing-wem command line.

IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first and restart WEM


=== Database Connector

```shell
cd turing
./gradlew turing-jdbc:shadowJar
```
IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first and restart WEM

=== Filesystem Connector

```shell
cd turing
./gradlew turing-filesystem:shadowJar
```
IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first and restart WEM

=== Nutch
==== Nutch 1.12
```shell
cd turing/
./gradlew turing-nuch:nutch1_12:packageDistribution
```
For development, copy the files of turing-nutch/nutch1_12/build/extracted_dist to APACHE_NUTCH1_12/plugins/indexer-viglet-turing

==== Nutch 1.18
```shell
cd turing/
./gradlew turing-nuch:nutch1_18:packageDistribution
```
For development, copy the files of turing-nutch/nutch1_18/build/extracted_dist to APACHE_NUTCH1_18/plugins/indexer-viglet-turing

IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first.

== REST API

=== API Overview

Turing AI offers a variety of robust, convenient, and simple RESTful Web service APIs to integrate data from Turing to any external system. Through Turing's API, your developers can create Web applications to interact directly with data that resides in Turing. Among the available features include RESTful APIs using JSON format, authentication via API Key invoking the existing user-level governance and security model built into Turing as well as a developer to manage access to API documentation and API keys. We have APIs to deliver search and cognitive features.

== OpenAPI 3.0

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to HTTP APIs which allows both humans and computers to discover and understand the capabilities of the service without access to source code, documentation, or through network traffic inspection. When properly defined, a consumer can understand and interact with the remote service with a minimal amount of implementation logic.

An OpenAPI definition can then be used by documentation generation tools to display the API, code generation tools to generate servers and clients in various programming languages, testing tools, and many other use cases.

Turing OpenAPI 3.0 is available at http://localhost:2700/v3/api-docs.

== Swagger

Swagger allows you to describe the structure of your APIs so that machines can read them. The ability of APIs to describe their own structure is the root of all awesomeness in Swagger. Swagger does this by asking your API to return a YAML or JSON that contains a detailed description of your entire API. This file is essentially a resource listing of your API which adheres to OpenAPI Specification.

You can access the Turing API documentation and test it directly using Swagger at http://localhost:2700/swagger-ui.html.


=== Generate an API Key

==== Step 1

Sign in Turing Administration Console (http://localhost:2700).

==== Step 2

Access API Token Section.

image::img/turing/0.3.7/api-token-menu.png[API Token Section]  

==== Step 3

Create a new API Token with Title and Description. 

image::img/turing/0.3.7/api-token-new.png[New API Token]  

==== Step 4

Will be create a new random API Token.
