[[configuring-databases-postgresql-requirements]]
==== PostgreSQL Database Requirements
This section discusses the steps required to configure PostgreSQL for your Turing ES databases:

* Installing and configuring the PostgreSQL Database
* Configuring the Turing ES user, database, and schema
* Installing and configuring the PostgreSQL Database

[[configuring-databases-postgresql-database]]
===== Installing and configuring the PostgreSQL Database
This section describes the steps required to install and configure a PostgreSQL database for your Turing ES environment. You will also need to configure the Turing user, database and schemas.

To install the PostgreSQL database:

1. Navigate to the following URL and follow the instructions provided for your supported version of PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/docs/manuals/

To configure the PostgreSQL instance:

* Open the postgresql.conf file (located in <PostgreSQL_installDir>\<version>\data\) and set the following parameters:

[source,ini]
----
max_connections = 10
max_prepared_transactions = 10
shared_buffers = 512MB
autovacuum = off
----

IMPORTANT:  The autovacuum daemon is used to reclaim memory/storage space the database is no longer using. You must re-enable this utility after you have finished installing and configuring Turing ES.

NOTE: Configuration values will vary for higher transaction environments and numbers of users.
max_prepared_transactions should be at least as large as max_connections so that every session can have a prepared transaction pending.

[[configuring-databases-postgresql-configuring-user-database-schemas]]
===== Configuring the Turing user, database, and schemas
This section discusses the steps required to configure the users, database and schemas for your Turing ES environment.

NOTE: You must be a PostgreSQL super-user or have createuser privileges to create Turing users. To create and configure the Turing ES database, you must be a super-user or have create privileges.

IMPORTANT: When you create a database table in PostgreSQL, the field name must be lowercase.

To configure the Turing ES user:

1. Create a user as the owner of the Turing ES database:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE USER turing PASSWORD <password> with createuser;
----

1. Create a Turing ES database:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE DATABASE turing_db;
ALTER DATABASE turing_db OWNER TO turing;
----

To create and access the Turing ES user and schema:

* Log in to the turing (database) using the turing account. For example, on the operating system command prompt:

[source,bash]
----
$psql -U turing -d turing_db
----

* Create the Turing schema and grant ownership to the Turing user:

[source,sql]
----
CREATE SCHEMA turing;
ALTER SCHEMA turing OWNER TO turing;
----

* Set the PostgreSQL search_path variable to the user to allow direct access to the respective schemas:

[source,sql]
----
ALTER USER turing SET SEARCH_PATH = turing;
----

[[utils]]
== Turing Utils

First you need install Turing Utils, that contains sample configurations and script to facilitate the use of Turing ES, so go to https://viglet.org/turing/download/ and click on "Integration > Utils" link to download it.

Extract the turing-utils.zip to /appl/viglet/turing/utils

```shell
mkdir -p /appl/viglet/turing/utils
unzip turing-utils.zip -d /appl/viglet/turing/utils
```

== Solr Configuration

You need to configure Solr to be able to store Semantic Navigation and ChatBot data.

[[solr-configuration-ootb]]
=== OOTB
With Solr running, go to Turing Utils and create the new cores that will be used by Turing ES.

1. Install the cores into solr:
+
```shell
cd <SOLR_DIR>/bin
## For Semantic Navigation
./solr create_collection -c turing -n turing -d /appl/viglet/turing/utils/solr/<VERSION>/turing/<LANGUAGE>
## For ChatBot
./solr create_collection -c converse -n converse -d /appl/viglet/turing/utils/solr/<VERSION>/converse/<LANGUAGE>
```
+
2. Started Solr Service

<<<

[[solr-configuration-infofusion]]
=== OpenText InfoFusion
1. Create the cores into Solr:
+
```shell
cd <SOLR_DIR>/bin
## For Semantic Navigation
mkdir <SOLR_DIR>/server/solr/turing
cp -Rf /appl/viglet/turing/utils/solr/<VERSION>/turing/<LANGUAGE>/. <SOLR_DIR>/server/solr/turing/
## For ChatBot
mkdir <SOLR_DIR>/server/solr/converse
cp -Rf /appl/viglet/turing/utils/solr/<VERSION>/turing/<LANGUAGE>/. <SOLR_DIR>/server/solr/converse/
```

2. If the core name of Semantic Navigation Site will be different, you need modify the `core.properties` file and change the `name` and `collection` attributes, for example:
+
```shell
cd <SOLR_DIR>/bin
mkdir <SOLR_DIR>/server/solr/sample
cp /appl/viglet/turing/utils/solr/<VERSION>/turing/<LANGUAGE>/. <SOLR_DIR>/server/solr/sample/
chown otif:otif <SOLR_DIR>/server/solr/sample

## Modify the name and collection fields
sed -i 's/turing/sample/g' <SOLR_DIR>/server/solr/sample/core.properties

cat <SOLR_DIR>/server/solr/sample/core.properties

numShards=1
name=sample
shard=shard1
collection=sample
coreNodeName=core_node1

```
<<<
3. Edit the `<IF_API>/bin/otif.sh` and add the new cores to sync with Zookeeper.
+
```shell
# Push Solr configurations in ZooKeeper
pushSolrConfigs() {
    ...
    cd "$BASE_DIR"
    # For Semantic Navigation
    ./zk.sh -cmd upconfig -zkhost "$SOLR_ZK_ENSEMBLE" -confdir "<IF_SOLR>/server/solr/turing/conf" -confname turing
    ./zk.sh -cmd upconfig -zkhost "$SOLR_ZK_ENSEMBLE" -confdir "<IF_SOLR>/server/solr/<OTHER_CORE>/conf" -confname <OTHER_CORE>
    # For ChatBot
    ./zk.sh -cmd upconfig -zkhost "$SOLR_ZK_ENSEMBLE" -confdir "<IF_SOLR>/server/solr/converse/conf" -confname converse
    # Default InfoFusion cores (Do not modify)
    ./zk.sh -cmd upconfig -zkhost "$SOLR_ZK_ENSEMBLE" -confdir "$BASE_DIR/../etc/solr/otif/en/conf" -confname otif_en
    ...
    cd "$CURRENT_DIR"
}
```

4. With Zookeeper running, execute the command below:
+
```shell
cd <IF_API>/bin
./otif.sh push-solr-configs
```

5. Restart the Solr.
