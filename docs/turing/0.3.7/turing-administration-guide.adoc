= Preface

Viglet Turing ES (https://viglet.com/turing) is an open source solution (https://github.com/openviglet), which has Semantic Navigation and Chatbot as its main features. You can choose from several NLPs to enrich the data. All content is indexed in Solr as search engine.

CoreNLP currently supports 6 languages: Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, and Spanish.

== Documents and OCR

It can read PDFs and Documents and convert to plain text and also it uses OCR to detect text in images and images into documents.

== Semantic Navigation

=== Connectors

Semantic Navigation uses Connectors to index the content from many sources.

==== Apache Nutch
Plugin for Apache Nutch to index content using crawler.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#nutch

==== Database
Command line that uses the same concept as sqoop (https://sqoop.apache.org/), to create complex queries and map attributes to index based on the result.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#database

==== File System
Command line to index files, extracting text from files such as Word, Excel, PDF, including images, through OCR.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#file-system

==== OpenText WEM Listener
OpenText WEM Listener to publish content to Viglet Turing.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#wem

==== Wordpress
Wordpress plugin that allows you to index posts.

Learn more at https://docs.viglet.com/turing/connectors/#wordpress

=== Named Entity Recognition (NER)
With NLP it is possible to detect entities such as:

* People
* Places
* Organizations
* Money
* Time
* Percentage

=== Facets
Define attributes that will be used as filters for your navigation, consolidating the total content in your display

=== Targeting Rules
Through attributes defined in the contents, it is possible to use them to restrict their display based on the user's profile.

=== SDK Java
Java API (https://github.com/openviglet/turing-java-sdk) facilitates the use and access to Viglet Turing ES, without the need for consumer search content with complex queries.

== Chatbot
Communicate with your client and elaborate complex intents, obtain reports and progressively evolve your interaction.

Its components:

=== Agent
Handles conversations with your end users. It is a natural language processing module that understands the nuances of human language

=== Intent
An intent categorizes an end user's intention for taking a conversation shift. For each agent, you define several intents, where your combined intents can handle a complete conversation.

=== Actions
The field of action is a simple field of convenience that helps to execute logic in the service.

=== Entity
Each intent parameter has a type, called an entity type, that dictates exactly how the data in an end user expression is extracted.

=== Training
Defines and corrects intents.

=== History
Shows the conversation history and reports.

== OpenText Blazon Integration

Turing ES detects Entities of OpenText Blazon Documents using OCR and NLP, generating Blazon XML to show the entities into document.

[[turing-console]]
== Turing ES Console

Turing ES has many components: Search Engine, NLP, Converse (Chatbot), Semantic Navigation

[[turing-console-login]]
