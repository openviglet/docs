== Preface

Viglet Turing ES (https://viglet.com/turing) is an open source solution (https://github.com/openturing), which has Semantic Navigation and Chatbot as its main features. You can choose from several NLPs to enrich the data. All content is indexed in Solr as search engine.

== More Documentation

Technical documentation on Turing ES is available at https://docs.viglet.com/turing.

== Development Structure

=== Frameworks
Turing ES was developed using Spring Boot (https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) for its backend.

The UI is currently using AngularJS (https://angularjs.org), but a new UI is being developed using Angular 12 (https://angular.io) with Primer CSS (https://primer.style/css).

In addition to Java, you also need to have Git (https://git-scm.com/downloads) and NodeJS (https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed.

=== Databases
By default it uses the H2 database (https://www.h2database.com), but can be changed to other databases using Spring Boot properties. It comes bundled with OpenNLP (https://opennlp.apache.org/) in the same JVM.

=== Language and Deploy
It uses Java 14 (https://adoptopenjdk.net/archive.html?variant=openjdk14&jvmVariant=hotspot) and its deployment is done with Gradle 7.2 (https://gradle.org/) and works on Linux and Windows.

=== Docker
To use Semantic Navigation and Chatbot you must have a Solr (https://solr.apache.org) service available. If you prefer to work with all the services Turing depends on, you can use docker-compose (https://docs.docker.com/compose/install) to start these services, we use the Docker Desktop (https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on computer.

=== IDE
You can use Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse (https://spring.io/tools) or Eclipse (https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) or Visual Studio Code (https://code.visualstudio.com/) or IntelliJ (https://www.jetbrains.com/pt-br/idea/) as IDEs.

== Download

Use the git command line to download the repository to your computer.

=== Turing Server and Connectors

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openturing/turing.git 
```

```shell
git clone https://github.com/openturing/turing-java-sdk.git
```

== Run during Development

To run Turing ES, execute the following lines:

=== Turing Server

==== Development

===== With UI
```shell
cd turing 
./gradlew turing-app:bootrun
```

===== Without update UI
```shell
cd turing 
./gradlew turing-app:bootrun -Pno-ui
```

==== New Turing UI

Start the Turing Server using dev-ui profile
```shell
cd turing 
./gradlew turing-app:bootrun --args='--spring.profiles.active=dev-ui' -Pno-ui
```

And start one of the components of turing-ui
```shell
cd turing/turing-ui

## Console
ng serve console

## Search
ng serve sn

## Chatbot
ng serve converse

## Chatbot
ng serve welcome
```
IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first.

==== Build
```shell
cd turing 
./gradlew turing-app:build
```

=== Java SDK
==== Development
```shell
cd turing-java-sdk
./gradlew shadowJar
java -cp build/libs/turing-java-sdk-all.jar com.viglet.turing.client.sn.sample.TurSNClientSample
```
IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first.

=== Build
```shell
cd turing-java-sdk
./gradlew build
```
Or use the jitpack into your project at https://jitpack.io/#openturing/turing-java-sdk

=== WEM Listener

```shell
cd turing
./gradlew turing-wem:shadowJar
```
For development, copy the turing-wem/build/libs/turing-wem-all.jar into WEM_DIR/libs and test the listener using turing-wem command line.

IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first and restart WEM


=== Database Connector

```shell
cd turing
./gradlew turing-jdbc:shadowJar
```
IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first and restart WEM

=== Filesystem Connector

```shell
cd turing
./gradlew turing-filesystem:shadowJar
```
IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first and restart WEM

=== Nutch
==== Nutch 1.12
```shell
cd turing/
./gradlew turing-nuch:nutch1_12:packageDistribution
```
For development, copy the files of turing-nutch/nutch1_12/build/extracted_dist to APACHE_NUTCH1_12/plugins/indexer-viglet-turing

==== Nutch 1.18
```shell
cd turing/
./gradlew turing-nuch:nutch1_18:packageDistribution
```
For development, copy the files of turing-nutch/nutch1_18/build/extracted_dist to APACHE_NUTCH1_18/plugins/indexer-viglet-turing

IMPORTANT: You need start the Turing Server and Solr first.

== Docker Compose

You can start the Turing ES using MariaDB, Solr and Nginx.

```shellshell
./gradlew turing-app:build -x test -i --stacktrace
docker-compose up
```
NOTE: If you have problems with permissions on directories, run `chmod -R 777 volumes`

=== Docker Commands

==== Turing

```shell
docker exec -it turing /bin/bash
```

==== Solr

```shell
docker exec -it turing-solr /bin/bash
```

Check logs

```shell
docker-compose exec turing-solr cat /opt/solr/server/logs/solr.log
# or 
docker-compose exec turing-solr tail -f /opt/solr/server/logs/solr.log
```

==== MariaDB

```shell
docker exec -it turing-mariadb /bin/bash
```

==== Nginx

```shell
docker exec -it turing-nginx /bin/bash
```
