If you run **Adobe Experience Manager** and need a real search experience —
facets, autocomplete, relevance, and increasingly AI answers — you'll quickly
hit the limits of out-of-the-box Oak indexing and start evaluating a dedicated
search layer. The usual shortlist is **Algolia**, **Coveo**, and
**Lucidworks** — all excellent, all SaaS, all priced per document and per query.

This post lays out the trade-offs honestly, including where the open-source
option — [**Viglet Turing ES**](https://www.viglet.org/turing/) — fits and where
it doesn't.

## The options at a glance

| | Pricing model | Data residency | Facets | Semantic / vector | RAG (AI answers) | AEM connector |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Algolia** | Per record + per search (SaaS) | Algolia cloud | ✅ | ✅ (add-on) | Partial (Ask AI) | Via integration |
| **Coveo** | Per query / seat (SaaS, enterprise) | Coveo cloud | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (first-class) |
| **Lucidworks Fusion** | License + infra | Self-host / cloud | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Connector |
| **Raw Solr / Elasticsearch** | Free / infra | Self-host | ✅ (DIY) | ✅ (DIY) | ❌ (build it) | ❌ (build it) |
| **Viglet Turing ES** | Free (Apache 2.0) + optional support | **Your infrastructure** | ✅ (auto from AEM tags) | ✅ | ✅ (built-in) | ✅ ([Dumont DEP](/dumont/connectors/aem)) |

## The real decision axes

### 1. Pricing model — per-document SaaS vs. self-host

SaaS search bills scale with your **content volume and query traffic**. For a
large AEM repository (hundreds of thousands of pages, public traffic), that
line item grows every year. Self-hosting Turing ES on infrastructure you
already run flips it to a fixed cost — you pay for compute, not per record.

> If your content set is small and traffic is spiky, managed SaaS may genuinely
> be cheaper *and* less operational work. Be honest about your scale.

### 2. Data residency

With Algolia and Coveo, your indexed content lives in **their** cloud. For
regulated industries — finance, healthcare, education, government — AEM author
content leaving the building is often a non-starter. Turing ES, Lucidworks, and
raw Solr/ES all index **inside your perimeter**.

### 3. Connector quality (the part everyone underestimates)

A search engine is only as good as how cleanly it ingests AEM. The hard parts:
real-time sync on publish, tags → facets, multi-language paths, author *and*
publish environments, and **cascade re-indexing** when a shared fragment
changes. Turing ES handles these through [Dumont DEP](/dumont/connectors/aem):
OSGi event listeners, `infinity.json` traversal, automatic tag facets, and
dependency-tracked cascade re-indexing — out of the box.

Raw Solr/Elasticsearch give you the engine but **none** of this — you build the
AEM pipeline yourself, which is usually months of work.

### 4. Semantic search + RAG without a second vendor

The 2026 reality is that "search" now includes conversational, grounded AI
answers. With SaaS you often add a separate AI tier (and a separate bill).
Turing ES bundles faceted search, **vector/semantic search**, and **RAG** with
your choice of LLM (OpenAI, Ollama, Anthropic, Gemini) in one Apache-2.0
platform — answers are grounded in your AEM content with citations, on your
own infrastructure. See the [RAG guide](/turing/rag).

## When to pick which

- **Choose Algolia** if you want zero-ops, your content set is modest, and
  data residency isn't a constraint.
- **Choose Coveo** if you're a large enterprise already invested in their
  ecosystem and want a fully managed AEM connector with a budget to match.
- **Choose raw Solr/Elasticsearch** if you have a search engineering team and
  want maximum control — and are prepared to build the AEM pipeline.
- **Choose Viglet Turing ES** if you want self-hosted enterprise search with a
  first-class AEM connector, facets, semantic search, and RAG built in — under
  an open-source license, with optional commercial support.

## Try it

Indexing AEM into Turing ES takes about 15 minutes — there's a
[step-by-step guide using the WKND reference site](/blog/enterprise-search-for-adobe-aem).

*Viglet Turing ES is open-source enterprise search with semantic navigation and
generative AI — an alternative to Algolia, Coveo, and Lucidworks for teams that
want to keep their content on their own infrastructure.*
