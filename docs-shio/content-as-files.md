# Content as Files

An agent's cheapest tools are the ones it already has: **edit a file, write a file, grep
a tree.** Every one of those costs a fraction of an API round trip, and every editor,
diff and version-control tool in existence already works on them.

So Shio projects a site to disk. `shio pull --content` writes the site as Markdown,
you change it however you like, and `shio push --content` sends it back. A rename is a
rename, a search is a grep, and a review is a diff.

The thing that makes this safe rather than reckless is the **three-way merge**: a pull
never clobbers your local edit, and a push never silently reverts what a curator changed
in the console while you were working.

```

Four roots, each with one job, and they are separate on purpose:

- **`content/`**: one Markdown file per post. **The path is the post's URL**, not its
  folder chain. A URL is unique within a site, so the tree cannot collide.
- **`folders/`**: a marker for a folder that no post names yet. It is a *separate root*
  because under `content/` the directories are URL segments, and a marker there would be
  claiming that a URL prefix is a folder chain, which looks right until the one time the
  two disagree and it silently creates the wrong folder.
- **`assets/`**: the actual bytes, at `assets/<site>/<folder-chain>/<name>`.
- **`post-types/`**: the model, as canonical JSON.

## A post

```markdown
---
site: mysite
url: blog/hello-world
type: Article
folder: /blog
publish: true
body: TEXT
---

First post. The body is the post's first HTML Editor field, and the frontmatter
records **which** field that was: so reading the file back never needs the model.
```

The frontmatter carries exactly ten keys, `site`, `url`, `type`, `folder`, `data`,
`body`, `publish`, `locale`, `movedFrom`, `files`, and everything a post holds that is
*not* projected is declared with a reason in a test, so a field the format cannot carry
can never be dropped quietly.

Four rules worth knowing before you edit one:

| Rule | Why |
|---|---|
| A file whose path and `url:` **disagree** is an error | That is a half-finished rename: a move on one side and a create on the other |
| **Only the `DRAFT` projects.** `publish: true` is an *instruction* on the way in, never state on the way out | A pull would otherwise keep flipping a field you did not set |
| The body is normalized **CRLF → LF**, and nothing else is | Losslessness beats prettiness: a value that would not survive the round trip stays in `data:` as JSON instead of becoming the body |
| `locale:` appears only when the page really declares one | A monolingual tree stays byte-identical, and two locales of one page are two URLs with `translationOf:` naming the anchor |

## Sidecars: code fields as real files

A layout's HTML used to project as an escaped one-liner inside YAML: no line numbers, no
highlighting, nothing `grep` could reach, and a re-escape for every tweak. Code fields now
land **beside** the Markdown:

```
article.md
article.HTML.html
article.JAVASCRIPT.js
```

Five rules, each with a failure behind it:

- **The widget decides which fields get a sidecar, never the post type.** A rule keyed on
  the type stops working the moment somebody models their own layout, which is the
  expected case, since a layout is content.
- **The file name always carries the field name.** `article.html` collides silently the
  day a type declares two HTML fields.
- **The bytes are verbatim.** This is the one place the format normalizes nothing:
  normalizing would make the value differ from the fingerprint taken from the server's
  copy, and every later pull would report a local change nobody made.
- **A file named by `files:` that is missing is a refusal**, not an empty value, 
  "empty" publishes a blank layout, and "absent" would make the push clear the server's
  copy.
- **A sidecar the post no longer needs is removed**, read off the disk rather than
  inferred.

## The merge

`shio pull --content` is a **three-way merge** against `shio/.shio/content-base.json`,
the last-synced base. Per field:

| Base vs local vs remote | Result |
|---|---|
| Only the server changed | the server's value |
| Only your file changed | your value, kept |
| Both changed, **different fields** | merged, you get both |
| Both changed, the **same field** | **conflict** |

A conflict **writes nothing and exits non-zero**. You resolve it with `--ours`,
`--theirs`, or `--show-remote` to look at the server's version first.

:::info There are no conflict markers, on purpose
`<<<<<<<` inside a field value is *content*, and the next push would publish it. A merge
that cannot be resolved leaves your tree exactly as it was and tells you which fields
disagree.
:::

**The base stores fingerprints, not values.** It is only ever compared, so keeping a
second copy of the whole site on disk (and in every clone, once you commit it) bought
nothing. A fingerprint is a hash *and* the canonical byte length, compared part by part, 
which turns a hash collision into a **reported conflict** rather than a dropped edit:
equal hashes with unequal lengths cannot be the same value. When that happens the remedy
is different from an ordinary conflict: the base cannot describe the value it indexes, so
the base is what has to be rebuilt.

### Pushing back

`shio push --content` compiles the tree into **one desired-state document per site** and
applies it through the agent surface's `plan`/`apply`. It is not a second write path, 
the same guards, the same atomicity, the same confirm tokens.

One rule that is the whole point of the merge: a post the **server** changed is declared
with the **server's** values. Declaring the base would revert a curator's console edit;
omitting the post would expose it to `--prune`.

`shio push --content --check` writes nothing and exits non-zero if the tree and the
server disagree: the drift guard to put in CI.

### Renames

A rename is a **move**, and the tree has to say so. Moving `blog/old-url.md` to
`blog/new-url.md` looks exactly like one file deleted and another created, and guessing
between the two is how a post loses its id, its history and its inbound links.

```markdown
---
site: mysite
url: blog/new-url
movedFrom: blog/old-url
---
```

The same key works on a folder marker, where the whole name chain *is* the address.
Without it, a delete-plus-create is what the push will honestly report, and a
`movedFrom` naming a file that is **still there** is always an error, because that is two
posts claiming one history.

---

## Determinism

Two guarantees you can build a workflow on:

- **A no-op pull is a no-op diff.** Serialization is byte-identical run to run: fixed key
  order, stable field ordering, the same trailing newline. Pull twice and `git status` is
  clean.
- **The round trip is asserted as a property**, not sampled: an adversarial value list
  (trailing whitespace, CRLF, lone `\r`, YAML keywords, numeric strings, BOM, emoji, `..`,
  a bare `---`) is round-tripped through every carrier the format has, post field, body,
  sidecar, asset path, note, and a post's own `type`/`site`.

Two refusals fall out of the same discipline, and both are strict on purpose:

- A **truncated** listing makes the projection partial, so the pull refuses rather than
  writing a tree that a later `--prune` would read as deletions. (`--allow-partial` marks
  the snapshot, and `push --prune` then refuses too.)
- `push --content` over an **empty directory** is an error, not an empty document.

A path that navigates is refused everywhere it could appear: an asset path containing
`.` or `..` is rejected, and a site name that has no faithful directory name is refused
rather than trimmed, because trimming produces a tree whose `site:` disagrees with its
own path, which every later command would reject.
