# Letting an agent in

An agent that can publish is an agent that can embarrass you in front of your customers.
So the first question about an agent-native CMS is not *what can it build*: it is *what
can it do to my live site without asking*.

The short answer: **nothing.** An agent's writes land as drafts, publishing is a
separate permission it may not have, a delete needs a token that describes exactly what
it is about to remove, and everything it did is grouped into a run you can read and
approve, or revert. The longer answer, including the parts that are **not** yet
covered, is this page.

## The invariant

**The agent path is never a privilege escalation.** An agent's credential does not
reach anything a curator's session cannot, and after the safety work it is not a
privilege *superset* either.

It also cuts the other way, which is the part worth trusting: where the two surfaces
disagree, **the stricter one is correct**. When the agent path turned out to enforce a
permission the console did not, the console was fixed: not loosened to match.

---

## The credential is not an administrator

An agent runs on an API key of **`AGENT` scope**, and that scope is deliberately narrow:

| It may | It may not |
|---|---|
| Write on `/api/v2/agent/**` and `/mcp` | Write anywhere else, on the Content Delivery API it is **read-only** |
| Read drafts (every agent read is draft-preferred) | Publish, unless `mayPublish` is granted on the token |
| Be scoped to named sites, carry an expiry and a rate limit | Outlive the expiry, or reach a site outside its allow-list |

An `AGENT` key is not an alias for a `WRITE` key: a `WRITE` key can patch published
content *outside* the agent protocol's guards, which is the whole reason the scope
exists. Give an agent a scoped, expiring credential: never a console password.

**A run has an identity.** Calls carry a session id (from `Mcp-Session-Id`, or MCP's own
`initialize`), and it is recorded on every history entry. That is what makes "show me
what that agent did" a query rather than an archaeology exercise, and it is never minted
per request: a session is a *run*, and one session per call would be the same as none.

---

## Writes land as drafts

Every write an agent makes creates or updates a **`DRAFT`** row. The published version
of the page is untouched until something publishes it.

Publishing is gated by **`mayPublish`** on the token, off unless you grant it. The check
runs **before the first write, and on a dry run too**, so an agent that cannot publish
learns it while *planning* rather than half way through a batch. Because a desired-state
document compiles to publish operations like anything else, the gate covers `apply` and
blueprints, not just an explicit publish call.

Grant it when you want an agent to run unattended and you have decided that is fine.
Withhold it and you have a system where a machine writes and a person ships.

---

## A write can be rehearsed

Any batch or apply takes `dryRun`:

```json
{ "dryRun": true, "ops": [ … ] }
```

It reports exactly what would change , creates, updates, moves, deletes, per address ,
and writes nothing. For an agent this is a cheap way to check its own understanding
before spending a write; for you it is what the CLI prints before it touches anything.

---

## A delete needs a token that names what it deletes

`post.delete`, `folder.delete` and a `prune` that would remove something take **two
calls**. The dry run returns a `confirm` token; the real call sends it back.

The token is a digest of **what the plan actually deletes**: not of the operations
requested. Three consequences, all of them the point:

- A delete of something already gone needs no token, because nothing would be removed.
  A document therefore stays re-runnable.
- Omitting the token is a **428** that hands you the token *and the list*.
- A token that no longer matches is a **409** naming what would go **now**. An agent
  cannot approve one deletion and use the receipt for a different one.

---

## Everything is attributed, and grouped into runs

Every write records who did it and which run it belonged to. The console's **review
queue** at `/console/admin/review` turns that into the curator's view:

| Action | Effect |
|---|---|
| Read a session | Every entry the run produced, in order, with what changed |
| **Approve** | Publish the run's drafts |
| **Revert** | Undo it, entry by entry, restoring an earlier version or pulling something back out of the trash |

Two design decisions worth knowing. It is a **view over the audit history grouped by
session**, not a separate proposal table: the draft row *is* the proposal, which is why
there is nothing to sync and nothing to expire. And it is **console-authenticated and
deliberately not on the agent namespace**: the human's veto is not something the agent
can reach.

Reverting reports what it **cannot** honestly undo rather than guessing. If an entry
names a deleted folder, reverting it restores the whole section, which is what a person
means by "undo that". Approve skips folder entries, because a section has no draft to
publish.

---

## A delete is a trash, not a hole

`folder.delete` and the console's folder delete move the subtree to the **trash**
instead of erasing it, so the operation the confirm token gates is no longer a *harder*
delete than removing each post by hand would have been. Individual posts behave the same
way.

---

## What is not covered yet

A reader who discovers a gap after trusting this page loses more than one who was told
about it. Three, as of 2026.3:

- **The trash is console-only.** An agent can fill it and **cannot list or restore it**: 
  there is no agent read, MCP tool or CLI command for the trash. Undo is a human at a
  keyboard.
- **`site.delete` purges.** Deleting a whole site removes it and everything in it
  outright: it takes a confirm token like any destructive op, but unlike a folder delete
  there is **no undo**. Treat it as the one irreversible verb.
- **Scheduled publishing is not a review step.** A scheduled publish fires on its
  timestamp; nothing asks for approval at that moment.
